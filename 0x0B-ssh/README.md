# Weather App Presentation

## Slide 1: Title Slide
- **Title:** Weather App Presentation
- **Subtitle:** Project Overview
- **Team Member:** 
  - Your Name: Developer

## Slide 2: Introduction of Team Member
- **Team Member:**
  - **Your Name:** Developer - Responsible for the entire development process, including frontend and backend implementation, API integration, and deployment.

## Slide 3: Project Inspiration
- **Story of Inspiration:**
  - The project was inspired by the need for a simple and efficient way to check the weather in various locations. The goal was to create a user-friendly application that provides accurate and up-to-date weather information.

## Slide 4: Technology & Architecture
- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Frontend:** React.js, Axios
  - **Backend:** Flask, Gunicorn
  - **Deployment:** Nginx
- **Architecture Diagram:**
  - Diagram showing the interaction between frontend, backend, and external APIs

## Slide 5: Core Algorithms and Code Snippet
- **Core Algorithms:**
  - Fetching weather data using OpenWeather API
  - Debounced search function in React
- **Code Snippet:**
  - **Backend (Flask API):**
    - The `get_weather` function in `routes.py` handles fetching weather data.
    - It first checks if a city is provided, fetches coordinates using the OpenWeather Geocoding API, and then fetches weather data using the OpenWeather Weather API.
    - If no city is provided, it uses default coordinates.
  - **Frontend (React):**
    - The `WeatherApp` component handles user input and displays weather data.
    - It uses Axios to make API requests to the backend and updates the state with the fetched data.

## Slide 6: Process, Collaboration, and Timeline
- **Process:**
  - Followed Agile methodology with weekly sprints.
  - Regularly updated the project plan and adjusted based on progress and feedback.
- **Collaboration:**
  - Used GitHub for version control and code reviews.
  - Communicated progress and issues through Slack.
  - Conducted regular meetings to discuss progress and resolve any blockers.
- **Timeline:**
  - Week 1: Project setup and initial planning.
  - Week 2: Backend development and API integration.
  - Week 3: Frontend development and UI design.
  - Week 4: Testing, debugging, and deployment.

## Slide 7: Challenges Overcome
- **Challenges:**
  - Integrating multiple APIs and handling different response formats.
  - Managing asynchronous data fetching and ensuring smooth user experience.
  - Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.
- **Solutions:**
  - Used Axios for consistent API requests and error handling.
  - Implemented debounced search function to manage API call frequency.
  - Tested the application on multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.

## Slide 8: Learnings and Technical Interests

## Backend Directory and Files
- **Directory Structure:**

# backend/ ├── app.py ├── routes.py ├── config.py ├── requirements.txt └── init.py



- **File Descriptions:**
- `app.py`: The main entry point of the Flask application. It initializes the app and sets up configurations.
- `routes.py`: Contains the route definitions and the logic for handling API requests. For example, the `get_weather` function fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API.
- `config.py`: Stores configuration settings, such as API keys and other environment variables.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the Flask application.
- `__init__.py`: Initializes the Flask application and imports necessary modules.

## Presentation Delivery
- **Audibility:** Ensure you speak clearly and at an understandable pace.
- **Clarity:** Avoid filler words like "Uhm", "uhh", "like".
- **Positioning:** Stay well-positioned on stage or in the camera's view.
- **Posture:** Maintain a confident posture.
- **Professionalism:** Dress professionally.
- **Timing:** Utilize the allotted time effectively, ensuring the presentation is neither too long nor too short.
- **Energy:** Present with energy and enthusiasm.
- **Engagement:** Engage the audience with a question.

## Live Demo
- **Web App Demo:**
- Load the deployed website during the presentation.
- Demonstrate key features, such as real-time weather data fetching and search functionality.
- **Non-Web App Demo:**
- Prepare a video demonstrating the application being used.
