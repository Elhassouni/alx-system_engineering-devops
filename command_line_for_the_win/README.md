# Uploading Screenshots to Sandbox Environment and Pushing to GitHub

Follow these steps to upload screenshots to a sandbox environment using SFTP and push them to GitHub:

1. **Take Screenshots**: Capture screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.

2. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**: Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

3. **Establish SFTP Connection**: Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. You will need the hostname, username, and password provided for the sandbox environment. For example:
   
   ```bash
   sftp username@hostname
   ```

   Replace `username` with your provided username and `hostname` with the provided hostname.

4. **Navigate to Destination Directory**: Once connected, navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots using the `cd` command. For example:
   
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/destination/directory
   ```

5. **Upload Screenshots**: Use the SFTP `put` command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment. For example, if your screenshots are in the current directory on your local machine:
   
   ```bash
   put screenshot1.png screenshot2.png
   ```

   Replace `screenshot1.png`, `screenshot2.png`, etc., with the actual filenames of your screenshots.

6. **Confirm Transfer**: Confirm that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory using the `ls` command in the SFTP session.

7. **Push Screenshots to GitHub**: Once the screenshots are transferred, you can proceed to push them to GitHub as mentioned in the initial requirements.

8. **Update README.md**: Make sure to include the steps you followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in your projectâ€™s README.md file. This will help the reviewers understand how you performed the file transfer using SFTP.
